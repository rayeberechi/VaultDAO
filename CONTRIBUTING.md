## 🌊 Stellar Drips Wave Contributors

If you're here through the **Stellar Drips Wave** program:

1. Browse our [Issues](https://github.com/otwizzy/VaultDAO/issues) labeled with `drips-wave`
2. Comment "I would like to work on this!" on the issue
3. Apply on the [Drips Platform](https://docs.drips.network/wave/)
4. Wait for assignment before starting work
5. Follow the contribution process below

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Rust** (1.70 or later): [Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- **wasm32 target**: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- **Stellar CLI** (latest): [Installation Guide](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools)
- **Node.js** (18.x or later): [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Git**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/VaultDAO.git
   cd VaultDAO
   ```

2. **Smart Contract Setup**

   ```bash
   cd contracts/vault

   # Install dependencies and build
   cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

   # Run tests to verify setup
   cargo test
   ```

   All tests should pass. If you see warnings about deprecated methods, that's expected.

3. **Frontend Setup**

   ```bash
   cd frontend

   # Install dependencies
   npm install

   # Start development server
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app should be running at `http://localhost:5173`

## 📝 Code Style Guidelines

### Rust (Smart Contract)

- **Formatting**: Use `cargo fmt` before committing

  ```bash
  cargo fmt --all
  ```

- **Linting**: Run `cargo clippy` and address warnings

  ```bash
  cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
  ```

- **Documentation**: Add doc comments for public functions

  ```rust
  /// Proposes a new transfer from the vault.
  ///
  /// # Arguments
  /// * `proposer` - The address initiating the proposal
  /// * `recipient` - The destination address
  /// * `amount` - Transfer amount in stroops
  pub fn propose_transfer(/* ... */) { }
  ```

- **Error Handling**: Use the defined `VaultError` enum, don't panic
- **Testing**: Add tests for new functionality in `src/test.rs`

### TypeScript/React (Frontend)

- **Formatting**: Code is auto-formatted with ESLint

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- **Component Structure**: Keep components under 150 lines
- **Naming**: Use PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions
- **Hooks**: Follow React hooks rules (use ESLint warnings as guidance)
- **Types**: Always use TypeScript types, avoid `any`

## 🔄 Contribution Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Use descriptive branch names:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-proposal-list
git checkout -b fix/timelock-calculation
git checkout -b docs/update-deployment-guide
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update documentation if needed
- Add tests for new features

### 3. Test Your Changes

**Smart Contract:**

```bash
cd contracts/vault
cargo test
cargo clippy
cargo fmt --check
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build  # Ensure it builds
npm run lint   # Check for linting errors
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add proposal list component"
git commit -m "fix: correct timelock calculation in execute_proposal"
git commit -m "docs: update DEPLOYMENT.md with testnet steps"
```

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### 5. Push and Create a Pull Request

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Then create a PR on GitHub with:

- Clear title describing the change
- Description of what changed and why
- Reference to related issues (e.g., "Closes #42")
- Screenshots for UI changes

## 🧪 Testing

For the full testing guide — including how to run tests, write new ones, set up coverage, and understand CI requirements — see **[docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md)**.

### Testing Requirements

### For Smart Contract Changes

- All existing tests must pass (`cargo test`)
- Add new tests for new functionality in `contracts/vault/src/test.rs`
- Aim for comprehensive coverage of edge cases
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Use `try_*` variants to assert on error types

### For Frontend Changes

- Ensure the app builds without errors (`npm run build`)
- Write or update Vitest tests for new components/hooks (see [TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md#4-writing-component-tests))
- Test manually in the browser
- Verify wallet integration works (if applicable)
- Check responsive design on mobile
